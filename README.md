### Leetcode Solutions

Welcome to my personal journey in solving leetcode problems.

I am taking part in a 4 week cohort during which I will be looking at data structures and algorithms- a chance to apply my theoretical knowledge to practice.

I am using my own knowledge to complete these problems, I am not copy/pasting answers- so, there will be errors in my algorithms. But, my ultimate goal is to understand the DS&A. I hope that the more I complete these problems, I can go back to my earlier commits, laugh, and refractor.

If you can't handle me at my O(2^n), you don't deserve me at my O(1). Or... wait. [^1]

So, to accompany my daily Wordle and [Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/) addiction, why not also solve a different linguistic style puzzle: leetcodes :D
